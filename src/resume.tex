\section{Work Experience}

\experience{Data Science Intern}{Safety Products, Johnson Controls}{Jun 2022}{Present }{
    \achievement{

    Developed a project to correlate alternative GeoSpatial data (such as Property Crime Index, Demographics, etc.) with traditional data points in order to generate ZIP code correlation heat maps that identify growth opportunities at the grass-roots GeoSpatial level to increase sales opportunities by 7\%. The location-based alternative data was imported using web scraping and the traditional data was imported via PostgreSQL from Google BigQuery. Data was visualized and reports were generated using Power BI. By initiating another project to optimize mobile views for Power BI, the number of unique views per day increased by 113\%.
    
    }
    \achievement{

       Prototyped a model to create floor-plans of your living space using a smartphone camera. PointNet was used to consume a 3D point cloud along with a parallel CNN branch to map the 2D point density of the data from the top view. Around 90\% of living spaces in North America don't have floor plans. If floor plans are automatically reconstructed by walking through the apartment, it can have a huge effect on businesses related to housing.

% ----- Additional Roles and Achievments -----

\section{Additional Roles and Achievments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\textbf{Teaching Assistant - SYDE600 - Prof. John Zelek:} Facilitated students with the SPRINT protocol for Engineering System Design methods applying the principles of engineering problem solving, research methods, systems analysis including modeling, simulation, optimization and design.}
\item {\textbf{President - department Graduate Student Association, uWaterloo:} Provided leadership in spearheading a work plan to develop, execute and monitor various graduate students events to promote mental health during the difficult times of COVID. Pioneered re-Introduction of in-person symposiums after COVID shutdown for graduate students to network and share their works.}
\item {\textbf{Winner of International Medical Hackathon:} Organized by CAMtech (Massachusetts General Hospital) in Mbarara, Uganda. During our team’s visit to the hospitals in Uganda, as part of a hackathon to develop affordable medical technologies for developing countries, we observed that lack of operational suction devices caused many fatalities every day in the entire country. To battle this unfortunate situation, we built a gravity-operated, non-electric suction device to replace traditional suction pumps in the hospitals where electricity is not reliable. On full deployment, this working prototype could potentially prevent around 20-25 fatalities daily.}
\item {\textbf{Founder and Leader of a Hybrid Vehicle Racing Team :} As a whole, the hybrid vehicle was a product of several key innovative sub-projects that led the team to win the Best Innovation award for the two consecutive years. Some of the most innovative sub-projects:
