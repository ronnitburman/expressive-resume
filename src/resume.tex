\section{Technical Projects}

\experience{American Sign Language Recogition}{\href{https://github.com/ronnitburman/American_Sign_Language_Detection_MNIST}{\underline{Github Link}}}{Jan 2022}{Sep 2022}{
    \achievement{

      Built and compared performance of various Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest classifiers) and Deep Learning classifiers for the American Sign Language dataset. Several dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to assess the complexity of the data and its compressibility capacity.

    }

    \achievement{

       Prototyped an ASL fingerspelling education system app which increased the effective learning metric by 2-3 times in comparison to the current technology in the market. By incorporating the ASL fingerspelling detection feature in the backend we were able to provide feedback on the correctness of signing to the user.

    }

\experience{GeoSpatial Data Analytics \& Data Visualization}{Personal Project}{Oct 2022}{Jun 2022}{
    \achievement{

        Cleaned raw data to extract zip-code and city data. Increased capacity from 100 requests per minute to unlimited requests by developing a package to bypass GIS API call. Visualized data for GeoSpatial analytics using ESRI modules in Power BI. 

    }
}

\experience{Building Traffic Characterization using Building Data}{Personal Project}{Jan 2017}{Jul 2018}{
    \achievement{

       Hypothesized a model to predict customer influx in a retail store using BAS data. Chiller Plant Optimization (CPO-10, CPO-30) on the output of this predictor leads to a potential 10\% reduction of overall operating cost of the store in terms of energy savings from the HVAC equipment.
